# songswithhandclaps
I once said that I had never heard a song with handclaps that I didn't like. Over the years, I've spent the occasional minute or two adding songs with handclaps to a playlist, which I plan to share here.

My sole purpose of this blog is to document all of the songs with handclaps that I've come across. If you have any suggestions, let me know.
